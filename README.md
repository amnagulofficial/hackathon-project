# Hackathon Project

A simple front-end web application created for a hackathon project.  
Built with HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

hackathon-project/
├── index.html
├── login.html
├── match.html
├── mook.html
└── style.css



- **index.html** – Landing / home page  
- **login.html** – Login form / authentication interface  
- **match.html** – Matching or results page  
- **mook.html** – (Purpose: e.g. mockup, demo, etc.)  
- **style.css** – Stylesheet to handle layout, design, and responsiveness

##  Features

- Simple, responsive HTML & CSS pages  
- Basic navigation between pages  
- Clean and minimal design  
- Easily extensible for adding JavaScript, backend, APIs, etc.

## How to Use / Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amnagulofficial/hackathon-project.git
   cd hackathon-project
Open the desired HTML file in your browser:

index.html — homepage

login.html — login page

match.html — match/results page

mook.html — mock or demo page

(Optional) If we later add JavaScript, backend server, or build tools, update this README accordingly.

Future Improvements:
Add JavaScript for interactivity (form validations, dynamic content)

Connect to a backend (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) to handle authentication, data storage

Make pages responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop

Add error handling, form feedback, routing

Implement design improvements, UI/UX polish

 Notes / Known Issues:
Currently no backend — all pages are static

No input validation or security measures yet

Styling is basic — may not look perfect on all screen sizes
